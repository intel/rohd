## Learning Outcome

In this chapter:

- You will lern how to use ROHD abstraction to speed up the development process.

## ROHD Abstraction

ROHD provides several abstraction layer to fasten the development work. As of now, ROHD provides several abstraction catalog which listed as below:

### [Interface](01_interface.md)

Interface make it easier to define port connections of a module in a reusable way.

### [Finite State Machine (FSM)](02_finite_state_machine.md)

An easy and more verbose implementation of Finite State Machine with ROHD API.

### [Pipeline](03_pipeline.md)

Pipeline can be build with ROHD API in a simple and refractable way.
