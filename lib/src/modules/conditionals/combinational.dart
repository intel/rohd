  /// Wikipedia article has a good explanation:
  /// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single-assignment_form
  ///
  /// In SystemVerilog, an `always_comb` block can easily produce
  /// non-synthesizable or ambiguous design blocks which can lead to subtle
  /// bugs and mismatches between simulation and synthesis.  Since
  /// [Combinational] maps directly to an `always_comb` block, it is also
  /// susceptible to these types of issues in the path to synthesis.
  ///
  /// A large class of  these issues can be prevented by avoiding a "write after
  /// read" scenario, where a signal is assigned a value after that value would
  /// have had an impact on prior procedural assignment in that same
  /// [Combinational] execution.
  ///
  /// [Combinational.ssa] remaps signals such that signals are only "written"
  /// once.
  ///
  /// The below example shows a simple use case:
  /// ```dart
  /// Combinational.ssa((s) => [
  ///   s(y) < 1,
  ///   s(y) < s(y) + 1,
  /// ]);
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Note that every variable in this case must be "initialized" before it
  /// can be used.
  ///
  /// Note that signals returned by the remapping function (`s`) are tied to
  /// this specific instance of [Combinational] and shouldn't be used elsewhere
  /// or you may see unexpected behavior.  Also note that each instance of
  /// signal returned by the remapping function should be used in at most
  /// one [Conditional] and on either the receiving or driving side, but not
  /// both.  These restrictions are generally easy to adhere to unless you do
  /// something strange.
  ///
  /// There is a construction-time performance penalty for usage of this
  /// roughly proportional to the size of the design feeding into this instance.
  /// This is because it must search for any remapped signals along the entire
  /// combinational and sequential path feeding into each [Conditional].  This
  /// penalty is purely at generation time, not in simulation or the actual
  /// generated design.  For very large designs, this penalty can be
  /// mitigated by constructing the [Combinational.ssa] before connecting
  /// inputs to the rest of the design, but usually the impact is so small
  /// that it will not be noticeable.
