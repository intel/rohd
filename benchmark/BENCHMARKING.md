Benchmarking in ROHD
====================

This folder contains some benchmarking related code for estimating relative performance of certain ROHD features.  It can be used to help judge the relative performance impact with and without a change in ROHD.  Benchmarks can be microbenchmarks for a specific feature, larger benchmarks for estimating performance on more realistic designs, or comparison benchmarks for similar applications relative to other frameworks and simulators.
